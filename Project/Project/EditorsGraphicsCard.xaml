There weren't many the only disadvantage is the size of the card was difficult to navigate into place in the case as the inside is so confined and it took a while to install. The advantages to this card is that it is new and budget friendly and perfetly suited to this build including the white colour and in general with 6GB of memory on the card most games will run graphics at high with this card and CPU combined."
