I choose this motherboard as it is the perfect size to fit into the case while also accomodating the inside needs for the parts. The motherboard is cheap and reliable and I feel this is the best option as with a small case the options are limited but this is the best option in this category."

                <Label Text="There were many advantages and disadvantages to this motherboard. Firstly the disadvantages. This motherboard is good but it comes with limited extension slots for RAM. It comes with 4 sloths but while using 4GB sticks of RAM this space can become used very quickly. I also find the space between part is very small. The advantages are that this motherboard is cheap and does the job perfectly and comes with a PCI-E slot for the graphics card which is just a faster version of a PCI slot."
